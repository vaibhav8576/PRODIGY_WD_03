The objective of the tic tac toe game in JavaScript is to create a two-player game where each player takes turns to mark X or O on a 3x3 grid. The player who successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Players take turns clicking on the cells to make their moves, and the game displays a message when someone wins or when it's a draw.
